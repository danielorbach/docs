# About multinode
If you have multiple instances of PostgreSQL running TimescaleDB 2.0 or greater,
you can set them up to act as a TimescaleDB multi-node environment.

TimescaleDB multi-node can be created as part of a self-managed deployment or as
a managed cloud deployment.

To set up a self-managed cluster, including configuring the nodes for secure
communication and creating users and roles across servers, follow the
instructions in this section.

If you would like to give multi-node a try  without the management overhead, you
can [setup and explore a multi-node cluster in Timescale
Forge][multi_node_forge],  our fully managed database
service. [Sign-up for your free](https://forge.timescale.com/signup), 30-day
