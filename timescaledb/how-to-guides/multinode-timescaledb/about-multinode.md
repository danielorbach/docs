# About multinode
If you have multiple instances of PostgreSQL running TimescaleDB 2.0 or greater,
you can set them up to act as a TimescaleDB multi-node environment. TimescaleDB
multi-node can be created as part of a self-managed deployment or as a managed
cloud deployment.

This section contains instructions to set up a self-managed cluster, including
configuring the nodes for secure communication and creating users and roles
across servers.

You can use multinode on a self-managed TimescaleDB instance, or you can use it
on [Timescale Forge][multinode_forge] or [Timescale Cloud][multinode_cloud].
